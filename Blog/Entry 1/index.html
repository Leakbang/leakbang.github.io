                    <br><b>Comments:</b> Perhaps the most interesting operating system. Great place for coders to experiment. A ton of exclusive applications and games to try out. It's recommended to run it in a VM.

                    <br><b>Comments:</b> Really amazing pieces of software. They use machine learning AI to do magic. They are expensive, but based on my experience, they do the job far better than other softwares in the competition.

                <h2>WMware Workstation</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Info:</b> Extremely agile software for running virtual machines on Windows, Linux, and mac.

                    <br><b>Comments:</b> From my experience, it's the best software in the competition. It is packed with features and runs much faster than other VM software like virutalbox. It costs a bunch, but if you use VMs professionally it's definitely the way to go. For personal use, there is VMware workstation player which is the free, lite version. Still better than VitualBox.

                <h2>ZeroNet</h2>

                    <br><b>Comments:</b> A decentralized network of websites and webservices, uncensored. It being uncensored means that a lot of questionable content can be found on it but overall, it's a very good piece of software. Everything is routed through TOR.

                    <br><b>Comments:</b> Highly recommended. Probably the most secure and anonymous way to use a computer. I heavily recommend to install it to a bootable USB rather than running it in a Virtual Machine. While it can be used as a daily driver, it is not it's main purpose. I cannot recommend this enough. You can access the internet and do your tasks anonymously on any machine. Everything is routed through TOR.
